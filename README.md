# delivery2

At this moment of the second delivery I have only a test to show that the api works and it can be used to search for gifs, if you want to test it out, on the FutureBuilder you can change the thing it searches for by changing "tonto manel" for any other concept you want to search.
The figma design right now is really simple as it's only the concept of the app and the overall decoration may be different for the next delivery.
